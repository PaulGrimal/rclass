This is a list of links to resources for students on R for Energy Economics and Policy.

### Main resources
- [The R Project for Statistical Computing](http://www.r-project.org): Download R here. Some basic introductory information as well.
- [GitHub](https://www.github.com): You will need to make an account here for the class. It's good practice to use git when coding and you can learn from established programmers.
- [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com): This is an 'integrated development environment' (IDE) for R. We will be using it in this course.
- [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com): A 'best of' R blogs. Usually interesting.
- [idre at UCLA](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/): The Institute for Digital Research and Education at UCLA has a lot of very good resources for learning R. Some of the content is dated.

### Text editors
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com): *Windows*, *OS X*, and *Linux*. This is the text editor I use and I thoroughly recommend it.
- [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org): *Windows* only.
- [jEdit](http://www.jedit.org): *Windows*, *OS X*, and *Linux*.

### Online interactive R classes
